# Hangman

I wrote this program as a final project for Udemy.com's 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero in Python course.
It is designed to take Dictionary.com's word of the day and use that as the word for Hangman.
This was not a tutorial or anything, the code is my own and therefore a little sloppy, but I'm learning :)
